# Minutes of Meetings and Calls

## Minutes of Call 6 Nov 2019

Date
-----
6 November 2019

Participants
------

- Philipp
- Masoud
- Niels
- Anne

Agenda
------

**Sectors**
- selection: 5 pillars + Ressortforschung
- 2 cases that appear twice (in different sectors)
  - include in analyses on the level of sectors, count them only for one sector in analyses on the national level
- 5 pillars: number of institutions seem correct
- Ressortforschung: include them in the dataset, maybe exclude them for the analyses later on

**OA Types**
- as agreed upon in the first call (see [below](#minutes-of-initiating-call-17-oct-2019)): own classification, implemented by Göttingen
- ask Stephan again about making the Unpwaywall dataset available
- start matching and classification in two to three weeks (hopefully with dataset in KB, if not other solution)

**Research questions**
- Focus on first one: OA shares
- Citation analysis: Compare closed vs. gold or green vs. closed or gold vs. green ?
- Collaboration analysis in a separate paper, but have an eye on average number of coauthors

**Timeline**

- complete until Status meeting in January
- start literature review based on OASE-grant application (Philipp), add reviews of newer papers, Piwowar and so on (everybody)


## Minutes of Call 30 Oct 2019

Date

30 October 2019

Participants
----------

- Philipp
- Neda
- Najko

Agenda

**Sector productivity**

- queries shared in the joint repository ([https://github.com/subugoe/oa-german-inst/tree/master/productivity_sectors](https://github.com/subugoe/oa-german-inst/tree/master/productivity_sectors))
- resulting numbers: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FgpCs6Ar91DvU8NsqHRyk_JG_AvivDg2/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FgpCs6Ar91DvU8NsqHRyk_JG_AvivDg2/view)
- potential additional sectors of 'Ressortforschung' have relatively low publication output

**Open Questions**

- Matching based purely on doi or additionally on title for increased precision?
- Which institutions to select? In particular, including Ressortforschung or not?
- Which research question(s) to focus on?

**Next call**

Next week Wednesday, depending on Niels' schedule


## Minutes of Initiating Call 17 Oct 2019

Agenda

See also shared document of this initial call [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hzOFxW1DNEzfs3bX5VkPKkMefK7Nw-Elo0GtlfpNma4/edit#).

**Previous work**

- OASE: [ISSI paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00011)
- OAUNI: [talk at OA Tage](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cKVjxyq1XZpe1ITGb9Up38SBWDz7z0c1NwPVqH56fM4/edit?usp=sharing)

**Data selection**

- **sectors**
  - investigate productivity, then agree upon sampling
  - e.g. five-pillar approach
  - or publicly funded research (highlighted in green in [shared document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hzOFxW1DNEzfs3bX5VkPKkMefK7Nw-Elo0GtlfpNma4/edit#))
  - still to decide: what parts of the analysis will be conducted at the level of institutions, or level of sectors, resp.
- **OA types**: own categorization scheme instead of relying upon Unpaywall oa_status, since some categories are questionable, and scheme may be subject to changes; use host_type field for classification (in Göttingen):
  - Host Type : Publisher / Repository (overlap per article is possible)
  - Sub Host Types
    - Publisher: Fully OA Journal / other Journal (mutually exclusive, using ISSN Gold List)
    -  Repository: Subject Repository / Institutional Repository (using URL domains, overlap per article possible) / Other repository
- **Time period**: 2008 - 2018 (not earlier since affiliation information most reliable from 2008 onwards)
- **Authors**:
  - gather all author information for each record, gather also tag 'RP' or 'RS'
  - some more discussion needed regarding which parts of the analysis should be restricted to corresponding authorships only
- **Document type**: Article and Review

**Research ideas**

1. **Investigate to what extent the OA fraction of the publication output of German universities/institutions has increased in the last years** - ISSI poster approach + a refined methodology (reprint authors + matching) and more data (mainly more institutions) and different OA types + Analysis with Unpaywall April 2019
2. **Investigating a citation advantage for OA (Gold, Green, ...) publications compared to closed** - replicating the previous research (Kurtz et al., 2005; Eysenbach, 2006, ...) on OA for the situation in Germany
3. **Collaboration analysis** in different sectors (Bielefeld), overview over German research landscape

**Tasks**

- Investigate productivity of sectors (@GESIS)
- Investigate collaboration network (@Niels), share recent paper
- Determine OA status for selected publications (@SUB)
- Set up GitHub repository (@Anne) to share routines, queries, and minutes

**Next call**

Wednesday, 30th of October, ca. 11:30 (directly after Status Call)
